            <em>Probate, Wills And Trusts, Trust Administration, and Real Estate</em></p>
            <p>JOHN WORDEN has  concentrated his practice in probate, wills and trusts, trust administration,  and real estate for more than forty years.   A graduate of Harvard   Law School  (LL.B. 1963) and St. Bonaventure University (A.B., summa cum laude, 1960), he  was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1963, and the bar of the United States  District Court for the District of Massachusetts in 1964, and is  Martindale-Hubbell AV Peer Review Rated.</p>
            <p>Mr. Worden has probated hundreds of wills during his career,  helping bereaved families by handling all the procedures in the Probate Court  so as to expeditiously settle taxes and other obligations and see to the  distribution of the assets to those entitled.   In many of these cases, he has prepared the wills or trusts that  facilitate the transfer of assets from one generation to the next (or to other  designated beneficiaries), protecting them for the long term by trust  arrangements where necessary.  </p>
            <p>As counsel for the Animal Rescue League of Boston, a major  humane organization in Massachusetts,  he has advised concerning thousands of bequests given to that organization over  the years.  In some instances, these  cases have involved complicated will contests, or applications for cy pres or  instructions from the Probate Court.</p>
            <p>Mr. Worden  also  practices real estate law, representing both buyers and sellers, residential  and commercial.  In this connection he  has participated in cases involving special permits, variances, and other  zoning matters before municipal planning and zoning boards. He has assisted in  the creation of numerous condominium developments.</p>
            <p>He is a member of the Massachusetts Bar Association, the  Real Estate Bar Association for Massachusetts,  and the Abstract Club, an organization of real estate lawyers established in  1883, and limited to 100 members.</p>
            <p>Active in his home town of Arlington, Mr. Worden has served  in many offices, including Moderator (1989-2007), Historic District Commissions  (1979 - ), Arlington Preservation Fund (president 1983 - ), Arlington  Historical Society (president, treasurer, director, trustee, 1972-2005), Town  Meeting Member (1970 - ), and many others.   He is also a director of the Animal Rescue League (since 1973), and a  member of its Executive Committee.</p>
            <p>He is married to Dr. Patricia B. Worden, and they have five  children and seven grandchildren.</p>
