In  1935 the Association moved to its present location at 50 Congress Street. In 1963 Henry D.  Winslow joined the Association, followed in 1969 by John L. Simonds. The office  then operated under the name Bolster, Lane, Simonds, Wadsworth &amp; Winslow.  In 1978, the Association adopted its present name, Simonds, Winslow, Willis  &amp; Abbott. Mr. Winslow and Mr. Simonds both passed away in 1999.
